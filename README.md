# 💻 Machine Learning

A personal endevaour to strengthen my understanding of python, it's various libraries, and their application in data analysis, data visualisation, and machine learning algorithms!

## Numpy 

A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

###  Methods, attributes and their purpose 💡

|   **Methods & Attributes**    | **Purpose** |
| :----------: | :--------- |
| `array()`  | Create an array, parameters include but are not limited to `array(object, dtype, n...)`.  |
| `arange()` | Return evenly spaced values within a given interval. |
| `zeros()`  | Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with zeros.  |
|  `ones()`  | Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with ones.     |
| `linspace()` | Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. |
| `eye`    | Create an identity matrix. |
| `random()` | Create an array of the given shape and populate it with random samples from a uniform distribution over `[0, 1)`.|
| `max()` | Returns maximum value found in an array |
| `min()` | Return the minimum value found in the array. |
| `argmax()` | Return the position of the maximum value. |
| `argmin()` | Return the position of the minimum value |
| `dtype()` | Return the object data type. |

## Pandas

A powerful data analysis and manipulation tool. This open source library has equipped me with the necessary skills to handle tabular and statistical data.

## Matplotlib

A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations in Python. An intuitive library due to my extensive use of MATLAB throughout university. 

## Seaborn
